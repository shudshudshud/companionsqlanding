                    <div class="alternative-details">
                        <p><strong>Strength:</strong> Adorable gamified self-care with virtual pet mechanics that makes habit building genuinely fun. Includes journaling, mood tracking, and basic friend features within a comprehensive wellness ecosystem.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>What it does well:</strong> Finch excels at making self-care feel rewarding through virtual pet growth.

                        <p><strong>Limitation:</strong> While Finch touches on friendship reflection, it's designed for general self-care rather than deep relationship intelligence. Friend features are secondary—you get basic pattern recognition and social encouragement, but no sophisticated connection opportunities or friendship-specific insights.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who love gamification, want comprehensive self-care tracking, and prefer a lighter touch on relationship analysis as part of broader wellness goals.</p>
