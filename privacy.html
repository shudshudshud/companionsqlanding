                    <h3>Our Privacy Philosophy</h3>
                    
                    <p>CompanionSquared is built to be your <strong>friendship map and compass</strong>, not a digital twin that gets sold to advertisers. Your reflections about the people you care about are sacred, and we've designed every aspect of our platform around that principle.</p>
                    
                    <p>We believe meaningful friendship technology requires genuine privacy‚Äînot privacy theater. That's why we've made choices that prioritize your trust over our convenience, your security over our growth metrics, and your peace of mind over our data collection opportunities.</p>
                    
                    <h4>What This Means in Practice</h4>
                    
                    <div class="identities-grid">
                        <div class="identity-item">üö´ <strong>No contact importing</strong> - We deliberately don't access your phone's contact list</div>
                        <div class="identity-item">üîí <strong>No social media syncing</strong> - We don't connect to your Facebook, LinkedIn, or other accounts</div>
                        <div class="identity-item">üìù <strong>Reflection-only input</strong> - Only the thoughts you choose to share with us</div>
                        <div class="identity-item">üéØ <strong>Purpose-built processing</strong> - Your data is only used to give you friendship insights</div>
                        <div class="identity-item">üëÅÔ∏è <strong>Complete transparency</strong> - Full source code available for review</div>
                        <div class="identity-item">üí∞ <strong>No advertising model</strong> - We make money from subscriptions, not your data</div>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p><strong>Yes, this creates some inconvenience.</strong> You can't just import 500 contacts and instantly get insights. But that's intentional‚Äîwe want you to reflect on the relationships that truly matter to you, not optimize a database of everyone you've ever met.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>How We Handle Your Data</h3>

                        <div class="landscape-point">
                            <h4>üéØ What We Collect</h4>
                            <p><strong>Only what you explicitly share:</strong> Your text reflections about friends, your account email, and basic usage information to keep the service running. That's it. We don't scrape your behavior, track your browsing, or collect data from other sources.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h4>üîê How We Store It</h4>
                            <p><strong>Securely and privately:</strong> Your reflections are encrypted in transit and at rest, stored on secure cloud infrastructure, and never used to train AI models or shared with third parties. Only you can access your friendship insights.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h4>üîç How We Process It</h4>
                            <p><strong>Transparently and purposefully:</strong> We analyze your text to identify friend mentions, shared interests, and relationship patterns‚Äîthat's it. No sentiment analysis of your emotional state, no behavioral prediction, no cross-referencing with external databases.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h4>üóëÔ∏è How You Control It</h4>
                            <p><strong>Complete ownership:</strong> Delete individual reflections, archive entire friendships, or remove your account entirely with one click. Data export functionality is high on our priority list, and we're actively working toward full GDPR compliance.</p>

                            <p><strong>Working toward full compliance:</strong> We're actively implementing GDPR requirements and will provide regular updates on our compliance status. We respect your data rights regardless of your location.</p>

                            <p><strong>Optional convenience, mandatory privacy:</strong> We plan to add basic contact storage (birthdays, phone numbers) as an optional feature‚Äîbut only for information you manually choose to add, never through automatic importing.</p>

                <h3>Questions or Concerns?</h3>
                <p>Privacy shouldn't be mysterious. If you have questions about how we handle your data, concerns about our practices, or suggestions for improvement, please reach out directly:</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 0.95rem; color: #718096;">I read every email and typically respond within 24 hours. For GDPR-related requests, I'll respond within 48 hours as we work toward full compliance.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Building trust takes time, and I understand that privacy is earned, not declared. My intention is to create friendship technology that genuinely serves you without exploiting your relationships. I hope that intention comes through in how we've built CompanionSquared, and I'm committed to being transparent about our practices as we grow.</p>
